      Hello, people I know, knew, will know. Maybe it would be
      good why I started this website. Yes, I know, it looks strange
      that this kind of website starts at my age, 41 years old.
      I worked with airlines quite a long time and I fell in love with
      systems there but I used to ask myself 'Hey do you really know IT?'
      I decided to learn coding first.
      I know that I will fail to be an expert at this age.
      However, I want to know this field even though I can't reach to the
      certain level.</p>
